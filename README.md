## Functionality

    The page loads when you open the url
    When first loaded all it has is a search bar
    When you type in a character into the bar and click search it loads character information
    The character information is a picture of them, information about them, and 5 of their comics and info about them
    When you click search it also adds that to your search history
    if you click a previous search it searches for them
    If you click a hero from the comics it searches for them

## Developement Process

    Ryan developed the Marvek API and the JS for how the page interacts with that information
    Duane developed the Wiki API and how the JS grabs and displays that data on the page
    Samantha was in charge of the overall Page layout and setting up the background and the history page
    Hunter was in charge of the character and comic cards and how those flexed around

## Usage

    Type in a character and it will show you information about them. Click on a character name and it will show you information about them

## Technologies Used

    CSS (Tailwind)
    JS (moment, jquery)
    HTML
    Marvel Comics API
    MediaWiki API
    Hashify API
    Google Fonts

## Challenges Encountered

    The first problem encounted was thinking of an idea. This did not come easy to our team and once we first decided upon the idea we started work.
    The next problem was that our main API (Marvel) needed to generate a unique md5 Hash for every search. We found an api that allowed us to make a has.
    Another challenge was that we struggled on how to grab certain data off the wiki API.
